Credit for the sprites goes to Phoney badger (https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger) and Findarato, I took the sprites from pokemon-colorscripts (https://github.com/Findarato/pokemon-colorscripts).

This is the first game created by me (thewindgods). I can't say I did it all by myself however, as I relied heavily upon ChatGPT to make it.
